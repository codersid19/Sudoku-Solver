# Sudoku Solver

The Sudoku Solver is a Python application that utilizes backtracking algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles. Sudoku is a popular puzzle game that requires filling a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. This project aims to provide a simple yet efficient solution to automatically solve Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulties.

## Features

- **Backtracking Algorithm:** The solver employs a backtracking algorithm, a brute-force approach, to recursively fill in the Sudoku grid while ensuring all constraints are met.
- **Efficient Solution:** By systematically exploring possible solutions and backtracking when necessary, the solver efficiently finds the correct solution for Sudoku puzzles.
- **Input Flexibility:** Users can input Sudoku puzzles in various formats, such as a 9x9 grid with numbers or a flattened list of numbers, making it adaptable to different input methods.
- **Error Handling:** The solver includes error handling mechanisms to detect and handle invalid Sudoku puzzles or unsolvable scenarios gracefully.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Sudoku Solver, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Run the solver script (`sudoku_solver.py`) with a valid Sudoku puzzle as input.
4. View the solved puzzle in the console output or customize the script to save the solution to a file.

## Usage

The Sudoku Solver can be used in various ways:

- **Command Line Interface:** Run the solver script from the command line and provide a valid Sudoku puzzle as input.
- **Integration with Other Projects:** Integrate the solver into other Python projects that require Sudoku puzzle-solving functionality.
- **Educational Purposes:** Study the implementation of the backtracking algorithm and its application in solving constraint satisfaction problems like Sudoku.
